# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Project Name: CRX Del Sol Information Page

### Overview
This project aims to create an informative web application dedicated to the CRX Del Sol, providing detailed information about various models including VXI, SIR, S, SI, ESI, and VTI. Users can explore the performance, specifications, and origins of each model. The application is built using Svelte for the frontend and CSS for styling.

### Technologies Used
- Svelte
- HTML
- CSS
- ES6 JavaScript

### Installation and Running the Application
- Clone the repository from GitHub.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Open the terminal to git bash. 
- Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
- Run the application with `npm run dev -- -- open`.
- Open the browser and go to the specified localhost port.

### Known Bugs/Issues
There seems to be a bit of lag from the background image when flipping through the pages.

### Planned/Future Features
Implement a search function to allow the user to search for parts.
Include a comparison feature to compare different models side by side.
Enhance the design for a more visually appealing experience.
Integrate a feedback system for users to provide suggestions or report issues.
